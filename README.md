Face Detection with Encoding & Prediction
This Python project uses face detection technology to recognize individuals based on facial features encoded into vectors. The facial encodings are stored in a .pkl (Pickle) file for efficient prediction. The system compares the facial encodings of incoming faces with the stored encodings to predict the name of the individual.

Features
Face Detection: Detects faces in images or videos using facial recognition techniques.
Face Encoding: Converts detected faces into unique encoding vectors.
Prediction: Predicts the identity of a person by comparing the face encoding with stored encodings.
Pickle Storage: Encodings are stored in a .pkl file for quick and secure retrieval.
Technology Stack
Python: Main programming language.
dlib: Library used for face detection and face encoding.
face_recognition: Python library for facial recognition (based on dlib).
Pickle: Python library for serializing objects (used to store face encodings).
OpenCV: Library for capturing video or image input.
Requirements
Before running the project, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x
opencv-python
dlib
face_recognition
pickle
You can install the required dependencies with the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python dlib face_recognition
Usage Instructions
1. Capture and Store Face Encodings
To begin with, you need to capture and store the face encodings of the individuals you want to recognize:

Run the script to capture faces:
bash
Copy code
python capture_faces.py
This script will prompt you to take pictures of individuals, extract their face encodings, and save them in a .pkl file.
2. Load the Encodings
The face encodings of the captured individuals will be stored in a .pkl file. This file will contain:

The encoded representations of faces.
The corresponding names associated with the faces.
3. Predict Faces
To predict a personâ€™s identity, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
python recognize_faces.py
This will detect faces from an image or webcam stream, encode them, and compare with the stored encodings to predict the identity.

Project Files
capture_faces.py: Script to capture images and generate face encodings, which are saved in a .pkl file.
recognize_faces.py: Script to detect and recognize faces from a webcam or image by comparing face encodings.
face_encodings.pkl: Pickle file that stores face encodings and associated names.
How It Works
Face Detection: The system detects faces in an image or webcam feed using the dlib library.
Face Encoding: Once a face is detected, it is converted into a numerical encoding using face_recognition.
Storage: The encodings, along with the names of individuals, are saved in a pickle file (face_encodings.pkl).
Prediction: When a new image or video frame is provided, the system generates a face encoding and compares it with the stored encodings. The system returns the name of the individual whose encoding matches the closest.
Example Workflow
1. Add Faces to the System
Capture multiple images of the individuals you'd like to store in the system:

Run capture_faces.py.
The script will save face encodings in face_encodings.pkl.
2. Recognize Faces
To recognize a person in a new image or video stream:

Run recognize_faces.py with a new image or webcam stream.
The system will output the name of the detected person, if their encoding matches with one stored in face_encodings.pkl.
Future Improvements
Integrate real-time face detection from a webcam feed.
Support for adding or removing users from the system dynamically.
Improve accuracy by training on a larger dataset of face images.
